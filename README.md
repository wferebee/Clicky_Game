### Clicky Game
is a Simpsons themed memory game. To win the game, click on a different card each time. If you click on the same card twice, you will lose. This may seem easy, but after each click, the cards are shuffled so you need a sharp memory to achieve a high score.

<br />
<br />

### Clicky Game was built using React.js and is component based. It uses "state" to keep track of changes and is able to update the page without reloading.

<br />
<br />

### Other Technologies Used:

  * JSX - a mix of Javascript and HTML
  * Node
  * NPM
  * CSS

<br />
<br />

## Here is a screenshot of the game in action

### React.js is awesome, and  I have left some of the intial ReadME at the bottom of this section incase youwould like to download my app and run it or build your own.

## Things I would like to add/ fix:
 * The user needs to be able to win the game, so maybe an alert or somthing else letting the uer know they have won.
 * Somthing in my CSS is messing with my ability to click on certain car positions, when the screen is not maxmized, all card positions are available to be clicked though, so im sure its just a css problem/ quick fix.
 * A "The Simpsons" suound effec when the user lands on the page.
 * A "Doh!" win the user loses.
 * A comment from Lisa Simpson win the user wins the game.

### Some of the initial React app ReadME

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
